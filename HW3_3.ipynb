        "Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a fundamental task in natural language processing that involves identifying and classifying named entities within text, such as names of people, organizations, locations, and other specific categories. In this homework, you will work with DistilBERT, a highly effective, distilled version of the BERT transformer-based language model, to fine-tune it for the NER task. DistilBERT’s deep contextualized embeddings allow it to understand nuanced information in text, capturing the unique attributes of each named entity within various contexts. By leveraging DistilBERT’s pre-trained knowledge, you will explore how fine-tuning on NER data improves the model's ability to recognize and accurately classify entities, enhancing its performance in practical applications like information retrieval, content analysis, and conversational AI. This task will deepen your understanding of both NER and the process of adapting pre-trained language models for specific natural language processing applications.\n",

It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file.
